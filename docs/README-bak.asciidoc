JGroups TankWar Demo
--------------------

* JGroups is a toolkit for reliable multicast communication. It can be used to create groups of processes whose members can send messages to each other. Group members can be spread across LANs or WANs. More details refer to http://www.jgroups.org/

* JGroups is a mature library used by Java Developer millions of time, JGroups TankWar Demo use basic JGroups API, it can be a quick start for Java Developer who want to build group communication application, the original code(GUI) came from my college homework

* Groups TankWar Demo Source Code `->` ./jgroups/tankwar

JGroups TankWar Demo Architecture
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

image::docs/img/tankwar-architecture.png[JGroups TankWar Architecture]

Key feature of JGroups TankWar Demo:

* Use multiple channels instead of use single one
* Sharing a transport between multiple channels in a JVM

How to run?
+++++++++++

* Navigate to DEMO_HOME/bin execute the following bootstrap script, note that, `-n` plus `a unique name` is mandatory, if `isGood` parameter is append, tank play as Alliance tank, or else it will be Enemy tank
----
./tankwar.sh -n node1 isGood
----

* On another Terminal start tank play as Enemy
----
./tankwar.sh -n node2
----

Actually, we can open more Terminal, start more nodes as below diagram

image::docs/img/tank-demo.png[JGroups Runtime Diagram]

Now 2 groups demo can emit missile attack each other, for details:

. Use arrow(up, down, left. right) move Tank, Tank can move to 8 direction
. Use `space` emit missile
. Use `F2` for generating a new Tank if current Tank exploded

JBossCache Replication Demo
---------------------------

* JBoss Cache is a tree-structured, clustered, transactional cache. It can be used in a standalone, non-clustered environment, to cache frequently accessed data in memory. JBoss Cache is also a clustered cache, and can be used in a cluster to replicate state providing a high degree of failover. 
* JBossCache Replication Demo is a demo what show JBossCache's tree-structured, clustered, transactional feature, we can easy track the replication process via demo UI, demo mangement console, bsh mangement console.
* JBossCache Replication Demo Source code `->` ./jbosscache/demo

BossCache Replication Demo key feature:

* How JBossCache build upon jGroups
* tree-structured, clustered,transactional
* 3 ways to manage or access JBossCache demo
** console - traditional command line
** GUI - java swing interface
** bsh - bsh console

How to run?
+++++++++++

Navigate to DEMO_HOME/bin, we will see JBossCache bootstrap scripts. Open more Terminal, start scprit as below will start JBossCache Demo in GUI mode:
----
./jbosscache.sh -c total-replication.xml
----  

Start scprit as below will start JBossCache Demo in console mode:
----
./jbosscache.sh -c total-replication.xml -console
----

Start scprit as below will start JBossCache Demo in bsh mode:
----
./jbosscache.sh -c total-replication.xml -bsh
----

How to run
+++++++++++

DEMO_HOME/bin has bootstrap scripts, Open 4 Termial(actually, you can open more), in each Terminal, execute the following commands in a sequence
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-distribution.xml
----

We also can run Data Grid demo use console mode, similiar, execute the following commands as below:
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-distribution.xml -console
----

Alternatively, use the following commands start Infinispan Data Grid as Replication Mode:
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-replication.xml
----

----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-replication.xml -console
----

Start Infinispan Data Grid as Invalidation Mode:
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-invalidation.xml
----

----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-invalidation.xml -console
----

Start Infinispan Data Grid as Local Cache Mode:
----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-local.xml
----

----
./dataGrid.sh -c infinispan-local.xml -console
